# compiler_bench
Simple program to benchmark different compiler performance. \
Current algorithm is the Pi(n) function. \
which is finding the number of prime numbers less than n. \
For following compilers are tested:

| Language | Compiler   |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Fortran  | `gfortran` |
| C++      | `g++`      |
| Rust     | `rustc`    |
| Python   | `cython3`  |
